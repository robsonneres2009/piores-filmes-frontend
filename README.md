🚀 Architecture:

🏛 The architecture is modular, considering that this project will be expanded and new modules with Artist or Theme will need to be created.

The App folder contains the page routes and layouts.
The Shared folder contains components, styles, and resources shared throughout the project.
The Modules folder is where project modules are created, allowing you to easily copy the folder and use it in other projects.
